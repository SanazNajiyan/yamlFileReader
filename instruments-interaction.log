WARNING: instrument "EUR" occurs in multiple places in hierarchy:
"currencies - currencies - usd-fx - EUR"
"currencies - currencies - eur-fx - EUR"

Equal weight "bonds : energies : currencies : equities : vol"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> y
Equal weighting "bonds : energies : currencies : equities : vol"!

Equal weight "long-bonds : short-bonds : STIRs"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> awawg
Equal weighting "long-bonds : short-bonds : STIRs"!

Equal weight "us-long-bonds : KR10 : eu-long-bonds"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> yesyes
Equal weighting "us-long-bonds : KR10 : eu-long-bonds"!

Equal weight "US10 : US20 : US30"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> YESS
Equal weighting "US10 : US20 : US30"!

Category "KR10" only has a single option, so no weighting decision to make!

Equal weight "OAT : BTP" (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> yay
Equal weighting "OAT : BTP"!

Equal weight "us-short-bonds : eu-short-bonds : KR3"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> n 
Not equal weighting "us-short-bonds : eu-short-bonds : KR3"!
Please specify relative weight of "us-short-bonds"!
> 8
Please specify relative weight of "eu-short-bonds"!
> 8 
Please specify relative weight of "KR3"!
> 4
Your chosen weights sum to "20". Normalizing to "1" gives relative weights of "0.4 : 0.4 : 0.2" for "us-short-bonds : eu-short-bonds : KR3"!

Equal weight "US2 : US3 : US5"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> ok 
Equal weighting "US2 : US3 : US5"!

Equal weight "SHATZ : BTP3"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> YIPPIE
Equal weighting "SHATZ : BTP3"!

Category "STIRs" only has a single option, so no weighting decision to make!

> wnlgiejan`lihjwrawngjonjlNLNGAJL
Equal weighting "EURIBOR : FED"!

Category "energies" only has a single option, so no weighting decision to make!

Equal weight "oil : gas"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> no 
Not equal weighting "oil : gas"!
Please specify relative weight of "oil"!
> 75
Please specify relative weight of "gas"!
> 25
Your chosen weights sum to "100". Normalizing to "1" gives relative weights of "0.75 : 0.25" for "oil : gas"!

Equal weight "CRUDE_W_mini : BRENT-LAST : HEATOIL : GASOILINE"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> sure
Equal weighting "CRUDE_W_mini : BRENT-LAST : HEATOIL : GASOILINE"!

Equal weight "GAS_US_mini : GAS-LAST"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> okk
Equal weighting "GAS_US_mini : GAS-LAST"!

Category "currencies" only has a single option, so no weighting decision to make!

Equal weight "usd-fx : eur-fx"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
> yeah
Equal weighting "usd-fx : eur-fx"!

Equal weight "INR-SGX : EUR : GBP"? (Type "no" or "NO" or "n" or "N" to give custom weights. Any other input will result in equal weights.)
